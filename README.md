## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view, create, and track the results of my workouts. I should be able to input information for logging as many exercises as I get completed in a workout on any given day. The exercises can be tracked by name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration. For cardio, I should be able to track distance traveled.
